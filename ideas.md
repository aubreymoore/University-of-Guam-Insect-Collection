#Ideas for NSF Proposal for Improvement of the UOG Insect Collection

## Current Status of the UOG Insect Collection

### Facilities

Facilities provided for the UOG insect collection are very poor.  It is currently held in a small storage room which is too small for equipment such as microscopes and cameras. This necessitates removing specimens from the collection and transporting them outdoors to a lab where there is working space and equipment.

The collection is protected by airconditioning and paradichlorobenzene (moth balls). However, airconditioning is unreliable, partially due to frequent power outages and the relative humidity in the collection is above 60% for extended periods of time, resulting in fungal growth on pinned specimens.

### Curation

The collection is maintained by the two entomologists employed by the University of Guam. Unfortunately, both are fully occupied with teaching, battling invasive species, and other activities, leaving little time for curation and improvement. There are no technicians assign to working on the collection. However, students are occasionally hired for maintenance tasks.

### Digitization

Label data for almost all pinned specimens are available in an [online catalog](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=180) which is part of [SCAN](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/). Here are current statistics:

```
34,520 specimens
24,571 (71%) georeferenced
9 (0.03%) with images
7,202 (21%) identified to species
232 families
417 genera
403 species
404 total taxa (including subsp. and var.)
```

SCAN automatically publishes data in a [GBIF occurrence dataset](https://doi.org/10.15468/8z7axw).  To date, this dataset has been [cited 31 times](https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=literature&gbifDatasetKey=56e311e3-43c6-4b99-aa21-af396074d5e3) and there have been 5,219 download events.

Note that digital images of specimens are not currently available. The next planned phase of digitization is to provide digital images for each species in the collection (not for each specimen).

## Justification

* Rapid changes in biodiversity caused by biological invasions are largely undocumented
	* The three most abundant trees in Guam's forests are being killed by cycad scale and CRB
	* LFA
* Taxonomic impediment.
* Client demand: EBL (Benita), DOD, CEMML, etc.
* Collection used as a reference library for insect diagnostics (extension), and for education (entomology students, school visits, etc.)

## Specific Objectives

* Develop as strategic plan to sustain the UOG Insect Collection over the next 50 years.
* Continue with digitization: images for each species (not each specimen).
* Reduce backlog of unidentified specimens
	* visiting taxonomists; loans program
	* employ modern techniques: DNA barcoding
* Work with CNMI Collection and other Micronesian collections ????
