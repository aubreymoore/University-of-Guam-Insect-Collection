# UOG Insect Collection Data Management

The University of Guam insect collection maintains a [web based open access catalog](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=180) which is part of the [Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network (SCAN)](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/).
The underlying software, [Symbiota](https://symbiota.org), adheres to modern biodiversity data standards and is being used by 73% of projects funded by the US National digitization program (NSF-ADBC).
Symbiota portals encompass vascular plants, lichens, bryophytes, algae, fungi, invertebrates, and to a lesser degree vertebrates.
Upon acquisition by the UOG insect collection, data for each specimen are entered into the SCAN database using an online form.
SCAN automatically uploads all collection records to the Global Biodiversity Facility (GBIF) where the entire collection catalog is made available for  [download as a Darwin Core Archive (DwCA)](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/56e311e3-43c6-4b99-aa21-af396074d5e3). Project collaborators will be given read/write access to the UOG insect collection online catalog to facilitate data entry and sharing of data within the project and with the larger community.
